# Logism-CPU-Design
This project implements a custom 18-bit processor using Logisim. The design includes a multi-cycle datapath controlled by an FSM-based control unit. The processor supports arithmetic, memory, stack, and control flow instructions defined in the ISA, verified through simulation and assembly testing.
